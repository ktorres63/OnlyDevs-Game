# Two Sides
Two Sides is a Cold War-style espionage simulation where you play as a communications operator caught between two warring factions in the fictional nation of Valcora.

Story
The authoritarian Nuevo Orden (Empire) seized power six months ago. In response, a fragmented resistance called La Llama Libre (The Free Flame) operates from the shadows. You work at the Central Communications Office, intercepting phone calls and classified documents. Your only goal: gather enough money to escape before it's too late.
